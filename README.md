In the housing market, comparative market analysis (CMA) is used to estimate value of a house with the aim of helping the sellers to set the house prices as well as buyers to make competitive offers. CMA is done by considering a number of features, such as location, years of the house, sq ft, view, grades and other features.

In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict housing prices in King County, USA based on the properties' features such as sq ft, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, grades of the properties, view, etc.

Prior to the model development, EDA is carried out to understand and extract insights from the features. This is also to identify features that are valuable to include in the prediction model.

**Business Question**: What is the selling price of a house based on given a set of house' features?
